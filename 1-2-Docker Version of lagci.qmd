# Docker Version of lagci

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. So it is useful for people who want to share the code, data, and even analysis environment with other people to repeat their analysis and results.

We provide a docker version of `lagci`, all the packages in `lagci` and the dependent packages have been installed.

## Install docker

Please refer to the [offical website](https://www.docker.com/get-started) to download and install docker. And then run docker.

## Run `lagci` docker image

In you terminal, run the code below:

``` bash
docker run -e PASSWORD=lagci -p 8787:8787 jaspershen/lagci:latest

The below command will link the RStudio home folder with the desktop of the local machine running the container. Anything saved or edited in the home folder when using the container will be stored on the local desktop.

``` bash
docker run -e PASSWORD=lagci -v ~/Desktop:/home/rstudio/ -p 8787:8787 jaspershen/lagci:latest
